# Car Price Predictor

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and location.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and feature engineering.
- `models/`: Saved models.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/joiz1/car-price-predictor.git`
2. Create and activate the environment: `conda create -n car-price-predictor python=3.8`
3. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
Open JupyterLab and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 85% with a mean absolute error of X. Feature engineering improved the model's performance by 15%.
