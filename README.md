Motorcycle Price Prediction
This project aims to predict the selling price of used motorcycles based on various features such as the age of the motorcycle, kilometers driven, and ex-showroom price. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and a web application to input new data and get predictions.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/joiz1/MotorCyclePricePredictor.git
cd MotorCyclePricePredictor
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Required Packages:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Preprocess the Data:

bash
Copy code
python src/data_preprocessing.py
Train the Model:

bash
Copy code
python src/model_training.py
Run the Web Application:

bash
Copy code
python app/app.py
Usage
Preprocess the Data:

The data preprocessing script reads the raw data from data/BIKE DETAILS.csv, performs necessary cleaning and transformations, and saves the preprocessed data to data/preprocessed_bike_data.csv.

bash
Copy code
python src/data_preprocessing.py
Train the Model:

The model training script reads the preprocessed data, trains a linear regression model, evaluates its performance, and saves the trained model to models/linear_regression_model.pkl.

bash
Copy code
python src/model_training.py
Run the Web Application:

The web application allows users to input details about a motorcycle and get a predicted selling price. The application runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

bash
Copy code
python app/app.py
Navigate to the provided URL, enter the motorcycle details, and click 'Predict' to get the estimated selling price.
